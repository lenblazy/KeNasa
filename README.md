# KeNasa

This is a SWIFT iOS client app using the MVVM architecture. It retrieves images from the internet using the NASA Search API.

The project adopts an MVVM pattern to allow decoupling of code. This enables each unit to be tested independently. It also allows the code to be scalable and make it easier to read the code. 

## Installation
You can either clone the project or download the Zip file. To run the application, follow the following steps:
1. Extract the project into any directory in your machine.
2. Open Terminal and ```cd``` to that project directory.
3. The project targets iOS 14 and above

## Technologies Used
1. Swift, UIKit and Storyboards
2. MVVM design pattern

## Challenges Faced
While scrolling the news list at fast speed, the images are interchanged and slowly change to correct images. Action point on preventing images from interchanging on fast scrolling.

## Testing The Application
I have written unit tests under the Tests folder. Feel free to add test cases.
